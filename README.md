# Harnessing Structures for Value-Based Planning and Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation code for paper [Harnessing Structures for Value-Based Planning and Reinforcement Learning]() (__In submission__).

We harness ....
We propose Structured Value-based Planning (SVP) for classical stochastic control and planning tasks.
We propose Structured Value-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (SV-RL) for xxx.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
The current code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, for both SVP and SV-RL.

- __SVP:__ The SVP part is mainly implemented in [__Julia__](https://julialang.org/) (and a small part in Python) for several classical stochastic control tasks. We use Julia version of `v0.7.0`, which can be downloaded [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases.html).
- __SV-RL:__ We provide a PyTorch implementation of SV-RL for deep reinforcement learning tasks.

**Note:** We test SVP implementation on Julia `v0.7.0`, which is not the latest version (and is unmaintained now). You may choose to use later verion of Julia if needed, but we didn't test on other versions.

### Dependencies for SVP
After installing Julia, just use the package manager within Julia to install the following dependencies:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
Pkg.add("PGFPlots")
Pkg.add("GridInterpolations")
Pkg.add("PyCall")
Pkg.add("ImageMagick")
```

### Dependencies for SV-RL
You can install the dependencies for SV-RL using
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structured Value-based Planning (SVP)

We provide implementations for two classical problems, the Inverted Pendulum and the Double Integrator. Note that the only difference for Mountain Car (and Cart-Pole) is the system dynamics, which can be done by modifying [`MDP.jl`]().


**Note:** Since we call Python for nmatrix estimation algorithm from Julia, you need to install [`PyCall`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package, and also place the `fancyimpute` folder under xxx path.
Solutions for common problems (such as import errors) can be found [here](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl).
